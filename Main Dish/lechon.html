         <h2>HISTORY</h2>
         <p>
            Lechon Kawali traces its roots to the Philippines, where it has been a culinary tradition for generations. The dish is believed to have evolved from the Spanish technique of cooking suckling pig, known as lechon, which was introduced to the Philippines during the colonial era.         
         </p>
         <p>
            Over time, Filipino cooks adapted the recipe to use more readily available ingredients, such as pork belly, resulting in the creation of Lechon Kawali.

               <ul>
                  <li>Step 1</li>
                     <p>
                        Pour water on cooking pot. Boil
                     </p> 
                  <li>Step 2</li>
                     <p>
                        Add the pork belly and 1 tablespoon of salt. Put some pepper pepper and bay leaves. Boil for 30 minutes or until meat gets tender
                     </p>     
                  <li>Step 3</li>
                     <p>
                        Remove the meat from the pot and let it cool down for a few minutes
                     </p> 
                  <li>Step 4</li>
                     <p>
                        Spread 1 tablespoon of salt on the pork belly. Make sure to distribute it evenly on all sections
                     </p>
                  <li>Step 5</li>
                     <p>
                        Start to deep fry the boiled meat. Heat oil on a cooking pot.                     </p>
                  <li>Step 6</li>
                  <p>
                     Put each piece of boiled pork belly into the hot oil with extra caution. Fry until crispy. Turn the meat over to completely fry the opposite side until crispy. Note: be extra careful when frying as oil can splatter. You can use the cover of the pot to cover it while oil splatters, but do not cover completely as steam will be trapped. It will cause more splatters.
                  </p>
                  <li>Step 7</li>
                     <p>
