          <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>
               The origins of puto bumbong date back to the early Spanish colonial period, with some believing it was brought to the Philippines from Mexico by the expedition of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi. It is made from a sticky or glutinous rice called "pirurutong," which is naturally violet or purple. The rice is soaked in saltwater overnight, dried, and placed into bamboo tubes called "bumbong." The tubes are then steamed until steam escapes from the holes. Once cooked, the rice is topped with butter, margarine, grated coconut, and sugar, and wrapped in banana leaves for serving.

            <p>
               Vendors sell puto bumbong, bibingka, and salabat outside churches or on the streets, especially during early mornings. Prices range from P10 to P20 per serving, with some offering deals for three servings for P25 to P50.
